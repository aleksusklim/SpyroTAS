
SpyroTAS is written in delphi and compiled with Delphi 7, but compatible with Lazarus / Free Pascal.
Source code is licensed under WTFPL (free, public domain).

You can redistribute and modify it without ANY restrictions.
You also can change "SpyroTAS" title, license, and authorship attribution – no need to mention me anywhere; you may use any piece of code here without referring the source.

However, the above in NOT applied to anything in \pngzlib\ subfolder of plugin source.
That code is licensed under something else, and I don't have any rights for it.
But I slightly modified it, and will ship with SpyroTAS anyway; I believe it's a fair use of that.
